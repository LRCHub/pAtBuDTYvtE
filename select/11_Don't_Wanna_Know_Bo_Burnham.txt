How are you feeling?
Do you like the show?
Are you tired of it?
Never mind, I don't wanna know
Are you finding it boring?
Too fast? Too slow?
I'm asking, but don't answer
'Cause I don't wanna know
Do I have your attention?
Yes, or no?
I bet I'd guess the answer
But I don't wanna know
Am I on in the background?
Are you on your phone?
I'd ask you what you're watching
But I don't wanna know
Is there anyone out there?
Or am I all alone?
It wouldn't make a difference
Still, I don't wanna know
I thought it'd be over by now
But I got a while to go
I'd give away the ending
But you don't wanna know
