It's over
Oh yes it's all over
And it's been a long time coming
Some say it's too long, oh oh

She said it
Ooh and now she'll regret it
But if she'd ask anyone
I know they'll tell her to her face, that it's too late

'Cause I don't wanna know
No, I don't wanna know
She can cry all she wants
She's not gonna bring me back, no, no

I don't wanna know
No I don't wanna know
She can try all she wants
It's not gonna get me back, oh oh, no, no

They warned me
Oh yes they all warned me
They told me now, don't lose your heart to her
She'll never give it back, no, no

Oh it's too late
She made a big mistake
It wouldn't be the first one anyway
Tell me how many more?
No, no, no

No I don't wanna know what she said
No I don't wanna know what she said
She can cry all she wants
She's not gonna bring me back, no, no

I don't wanna know what she said
No I don't wanna know what she said
She can try all she wants
It's not gonna get me back, no, no, oh oh

It's over, oh oh
It's all over
And it's been a long time coming
Some say it's too long, oh oh

Ooh they warned me
Oh yes they all warned me
They told me, "Now don't lose your heart to her
She'll never give it back", no, no, no, no

I don't wanna know what she said
No I don't wanna know what she said
She can cry all she wants
She's not gonna get me back, no no
But I don't wanna know what she said
No I don't wanna know what she said
She can try all she wants
It's not gonna bring me back, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
